### Wedge Box

> I like to call the simplest type of combat robot a battle box instead of a BattleBot 
> because this design invariably ends up looking like a pizza box. Many newcomers to 
> the sport dream about the impressive and destructive designs they see on TV, and 
> while they hope to build one some day, most beginners will start with a simple box. 
> A battle box has no frills, just the basics: a frame, drivetrain, and LOTS of armor. 
> Most roboteers will quickly upgrade this box with the most basic form of weapon–a wedge. 
> That is why I group these two related types together and call them wedge-boxes.

### Thwack Box

> Thwackbots are nearly as easy to build as a box, but can have a little more offensive potential.
> Essentially a thwackbot is a battle box with a hammer or axe attached to it. The robot can drive 
> around like the basic box, and some can spin in place to get the hammer up to speed for an attack.

### OverHead Hammer Bots

> Another crowd favorite is the vertical hammer bot (a robot that swings a hammer and tries to bash
> an opponent or poke holes in the top of an opponent). Not many people have been able to make a bot
> hit hard enough with a hammer (or axe, or pick, or anything) to do much damage to the relatively 
> lightly armored top of an opponent, so if you can perfect this technique you will probably have a winner.

### Spinners

> Next we have my personal favorite design, the spinners. Even Carmen Electra agreed with me in a post-fight
> interview that “Spinners Rule.” Spinner bots that are easiest to make include the bar and disk spinners. 
> A bar spinner is similar to a disk spinner in the way that it hits and in the way the robot reacts when 
> delivering a punch, but it weighs less. You can spin a bar or disk vertically or horizontally and each method 
> has advantages and disadvantages. For a vertical spinner, nearly all the roboteers will spin the attacking side 
> from the ground up so that when the weapon hits the opponent it throws the opponent into the air.
